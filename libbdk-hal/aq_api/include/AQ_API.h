Control of an Aquantia PHY is provided via the following enumerations and

AQ_API_StaticConfiguration. AQ_API_Configuration contains settings that may
be dynamically changed during regular operation, whereas
AQ_API_StaticConfiguration is used to report the state of settings that
would typically be changed only by provisioning, as well as the state of
pins as they are connected on a printed circuit board. Functions are

    function leaves the daisy-chain disabled to prevent RAM over-
    write. To exit MDIO boot-load mode, use the function
    AQ_API_EnableDaisyChain.
    Unlike most of the other functions in this API, this function can
    operate on a group of PHYs simultaneously. This is referred to as
    gang-loading. To facilitate this, this function takes as
    parameters 3 parallel arrays: PHY_IDs, provisioningAddresses, and
    resultCodes. The length of these arrays must be identical, and is
    specified by the num_PHY_IDs parameter.
    In order to check the integrity of the boot-load operation, a
    CRC-16 value is calculated over the IRAM and DRAM. After the image
    has been loaded, this value is directly compared against each
    PHY's Mailbox CRC-16 in 1E.0201.
    The value of register 1E.C441 must be the same for all the boot-
    loaded PHYs. This will be checked before the boot-load is
    performed, and if a non-uniform value is read from any of the
    PHYs, the function will fail before any writes are performed.
    A separate result code is returned for each of the boot-loaded
    PHYs, in the OUT parameter, resultCodes.

    AQ_RET_BOOTLOAD_PROVADDR_OOR: The specified provisioning address
    was outside of the permitted range.
    AQ_RET_BOOTLOAD_NONUNIFORM_REGVALS: The values of the register(s)
    that must be uniform across the ports being bootloaded were not
    uniform.
    AQ_RET_BOOTLOAD_CRC_MISMATCH: The image was completely loaded into
    memory, but the after the port exited bootload the running
    checksum that was read from the uP memory mailbox was not the
    expected value. This indicates that the memory has potentially
    been corrupted, and the PHY should be reset before trying the
    bootload again.
    Overall Return codes (the return value from the function call):
    AQ_RET_OK: all ports were successfully bootloaded.
    AQ_RET_ERROR: One or more ports were not successfully bootloaded.

/*! Measures the number of errors observed at the specified X/Y
    coordinates of the eye diagram grid for the specified SERDES lane.
    AQ_API_BeginSERDESRxEyeDiagram must have been called prior to this
    function. The number of observed bits that were errored is
    returned in the numErrors parameter. The maximum number of bits
    that could be errored is returned in the maxErrors parameter.
    numErrors/maxErrors gives the error percentage. The (0,0)
    coordinate represents the upper-left corner of the eye diagram
    grid, and the (31, 63) coordinate represents the lower-right
    corner. The current system interface operating mode (e.g. XFI,

    calling AQ_API_GetSERDESRxEyeMeasurement.
