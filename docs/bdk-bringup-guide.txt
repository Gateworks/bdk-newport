== Next Steps

After completing the test steps outlined in this document, most board
I/O interfaces have been validated.  With working DRAM and validated
I/Os, software development can start on the board.  Software should
burn the normal bootloader into NOR flash, overwriting the BDK.  This
can be done either using a flash programmer, or the flash menu in the
BDK.

.The Flash Menu

View flash::

Dumps the contents of flash in a hexadecimal dump.

Write flash::

Allows writing a file directly to flash.  Refer to the general BDK
documentation for information about files.

TIP: During the software development process it can be useful to have
known good binaries that exercise the board.  Keep the BDK around as
it makes a good test bench.  One board running the BDK can be used to
help debug software running on another board.
