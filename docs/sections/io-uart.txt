[[UART]]
= UART

The BDK doesn't contain any specific tests for the UART ports. The user
interface of the BDK is displayed on UART0 by default. Using this interface
validates the transmit and receive data lines. The user interface can also
be accessed from UART1, just hit a key when connected to the UART. The console
input and output goes to whichever UART received input last.

== Changing the BAUD rate

The BDK defaults to running both UARTs at 115200. This can be changed by
modifying the file *main.lua*. In *main.lua*, there are two lines related
to the UARTs:

.UART related lines from *main.lua*
----
-- cavium.c.bdk_set_baudrate(cavium.MASTER_NODE, 0, 115200, true)
-- cavium.c.bdk_set_baudrate(cavium.MASTER_NODE, 1, 115200, true)
----

. The "--" at the beginning of the line comments it out. Remove this to enable the line.
. The first argument is the node number. This is normally zero.
. The second argument is the uart number (0-1).
. The third argument is the baud rate (9600, 19200, 115200, etc).
. The fourth argument is whether flow control is enabled (true, false).

To change the UART setup, uncomment the line for the correct UART line
and change its parameters.  After making this change, run *bdk-update-all*
to update the Lua files in all BDK images.

.Shell command to run after Lua file changes
----
$ # Edit the main.lua file
$ bdk-update-all
$ # Reload the image on the target board
