[[MAINMENU]]
= Getting started at the Main Menu

After initial boot, the BDK displays the first, or main, menu.  This
provides a list of high level options that are available
interactively.  Most menu choices bringup sub menus of additional
options.

Each menu option supports a logically distinct set of options:

Configuration options::

Use this option to configure the BDK for your board.  The specifics of
PHY addresses, MAC addresses, etc change for each board.  See
<<CONFIGURE,Configuring the BDK>>.

File options::

Here you'll find options for dealing with the BDK virtual filesystem.
These are normally most useful when writing scripts for the BDK.

Flash options::

Option for dealing with a NOR flash connected to chip select 0.

DDR options::

Options for configuring DDR3.

PCIe options::

PCIe discovery, enumeration, and probing can be accessed through this
menu. See <<PCIE, Testing PCIe>>.

TWSI options::

Scan or probe TWSI bus devices.

SMI/MDIO options::

Scan or probe SMI/MDIO bus devices.

Interactive Lua prompt::

This provides direct access to the Lua interpreter running in the BDK.
This can be used to probe and configure any type of hardware inside or
connected on the board.  Scripting using Lua is cover in another
document.

Traffic Generator::

This menu option starts a simple network traffic generator.  It can
be used to transmit and receive packets on all packet
interfaces.  In combination with an external loopback, this can
quickly verify the interfaces on a board.

Reboot::

Perform a soft reset.  This can be useful for a quick reboot
without power cycling the entire board.
