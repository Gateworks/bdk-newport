[[MDIO]]
= SMI / MDIO

SMI/MDIO busses are used to communicate with Ethernet PHYs.  PHYs
support one of two protocols, clause 22 and clause 45.  Both of these
protocols are supported through the BDK menuing interface.  The main
SMI/MDIO menu selects which of the busses to access.

.Sample SMI/MDIO Main Menu

include::../captures/mdio_main_menu.capture[]

Once a bus is selected, various operations are available for both
protocol types.

include::../captures/mdio_sub_menu.capture[]

== Scan bus (Clause 22)

Performs a read from all possible SMI/MDIO addresses and list the
addresses where the reads succeeded.  This can be used to quickly find
all the device connected to the bus.  Note that the scan performs
clause 22 reads and may not show clause 45 only devices.

TIP: Note that the PHY address found here should match the PHY address
set in the configuration menu.

Read a register (Clause 22)::

Performs a SMI/MDIO read using the clause 22 protocol.

Write a register (Clause 22)::

Performs a SMI/MDIO write using the clause 22 protocol.

Read a register (Clause 45)::

Performs a SMI/MDIO read using the clause 45 protocol.

Write a register (Clause 45)::

Performs a SMI/MDIO write using the clause 45 protocol.
