[[QLM]]
= SERDES QLM or DLM

Low level QLM signalling can be configured and tested using "QLM
Options" from the main menu.  The QLM options menu is most useful for
checking SERDES lane signalling.

Once a QLM number is chosen from the main QLM menu, a sub menu of QLM
options is displayed.

WARNING: Many QLM menu items place the SERDES in diagnostic modes
where normal operation is not possible.  Power cycle the board after
using the QLM menu options.

QLM#: Show configuration::

Displays the current configuration mode of the QLM.  The mode was
determined based on the hardware strapping of the chip.

QLM#: Measure clock::

Measures the clock rate of the QLM's reference clock, using THUNDERX's
clock as a reference.  Verify that the reported value is correct for
the QLM configuration.

QLM#: Change de-emphasis and margin::

Allows manual configuration of the QLM de-emphasis and margin
(amplitude).

QLM#: Reset and power down::

Places the QLM into a low power reset state.

QLM#: Shallow loopback::

Configure the QLM to repeat all received traffic at the SERDES level.
This allows signal traces to be verified using an external signal
generator.  Some chips can only loopback a limited number of
lanes at a time.  If this is the case, this menu will show the
possible combinations.

QLM#: PRBS::

The QLM begins generation PRBS signal patterns and the receive lanes
lock on the incomming signal.  Statistics are displayed every 5
seconds showing the number of PRBS errors detected.

QLM#: Read JTAG field::

Provides a low level interface for reading fields internal to the QLM.
Only use this option at the specific direction of Cavium technical
support.

QLM#: Write JTAG field::

Provides a low level interface for controlling fields internal to the
QLM.  Only use this option at the specific direction of Cavium
technical support.
