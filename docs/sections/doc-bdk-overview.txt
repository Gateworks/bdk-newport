= Overview

The "Bringup and Diagnostic Kit" (BDK) is a set of executables and
scripts designed to ease the bringup of new hardware based on Cavium's
line of THUNDERX and OCTEON TX processors.  To ease development and
increase maintainability, diagnostics are written in a high level
scripting language, Lua.  Lua was chosen due to its simple syntax, ease
of integration with C, and small resource requirements.  The BDK is
capable of running a full interactive Lua environment from L2 cache
before DRAM is configured.

.Features of the BDK
* Simple menu driven interface for testing many I/Os.
* Built in traffic generation for ethernet based I/Os.
* Many I/Os can be tested before DRAM is configured.
* Prebuilt known good binaries for booting new hardware.
* Easy automation of tasks through scripts running on a PC.
* Fast PC based test development using a remote board.
* GUI based interactive script debugger.
* Lua remote procedure calls over serial.

NOTE: The BDK supports both THUNDERX and OCTEON TX processors.
Throughout this manual references to THUNDERX also apply to OCTEON TX.


.The directory layout of the BDK

apps/::

Individual target application source.  These use the BDK libraries to
implement the boot stub, hardware initialization, setup menus, and
diagnostics.

bin/::

All host binaries and scripts.

boards/::

Device tree configuration files for the various boards supported by the
BDK.  The BDK code normally doesn't change for each new board.  Instead
a configuration is added into this directory as a device tree source
file (*.dts).

CN*.asim::

Cavium Asim simulator setup files for the BDK.  Used by the "make run"
target to execute the BDK in Asim.

docs/::

All documentation for the BDK.

lib*/::

The source code for the BDK is divided into multiple library
directories.  Doxygen based documentation for these files can be found
under *docs/api-docs/html/index.html*.

license.txt::

The Cavium BDK contains source code from a number of open source
projects along with code developed by Cavium.  This file gives a short
overview of the various components and pointers to their exact license
information.  In the event of a conflict, the license file for a
specific file or project takes precedence over this file.  This files is
a summary only.

lua-modules/::

Lua scripts used on the target to implement the diagnostics application.

Makefile::

Top level make file for the BDK. Build the BDK with "make -s -j8".

target-bin/::

Target binaries.  The file target-bin/bdk.bin is the final output of a
BDK build.  Burn it to flash.

tests/::

Various tests used by Cavium.  Not supported for customer use, but may
be useful as a reference.

trust-keys/::

Signing keys used to support trusted boot.  See the section describing
trusted boot for more information.

utils/::

Source for host build scripts and utilities.
