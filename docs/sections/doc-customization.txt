= Board Configuration

Cavium's board-specific configuration software is set up so that code
editing is not required.  All configuration data is stored in a series
of device tree files in flash.  The encoding of device tree files follow
the Open Firmware specification.  Generic, non- Cavium specific,
information about device tree can be found at the following link:

http://www.devicetree.org/

Cavium software uses the *libfdt* opensource project for managing device
trees.  Source for *libfdt* is include with the Cavium source packages.

== Device Tree Usage

Configuration data is divided into four types of data:

* <<dts-manuf,Per Board Manufacturing Information>>
* <<dts-init,Common Board Initialization and Configuration>>
* <<dts-os,Operating System Configuration>>
* <<dts-board,Per Board Changeable Configuration>>

Each of these four data source are stored in independent device tree
files (*.dts).  The four files are merged during boot, presenting a
unified device tree for system software.

== [[dts-manuf]]Per Board Manufacturing Information

The per-board manufacturing data stores information set for the board
that never changes.  This data must be saved across software and
firmware updates and should be written before boards escape the
manufacturing organization.  This data contains:

* Board name (Examples: "CRB-2S", "CRB-1S", "EBB8800", "EBB8804", or "EBB8604")
* Board revision (Examples: "EVT4", "0.3")
* Board serial number as a free format string
* MAC address and MAC address count

When a board is booted for the first time, the firmware stops at the
*"Boot Options"* menu.

Someone in the manufacturing flow must enter the setup menu *"S) Enter
Setup"*.  After entering the setup menu, the manufacturing user will be
presented with the following menu:

----
Board manufacturing data is stored in a different location in
flash than other configuration items, so the settings in this
menu persist across software upgrades. Once set, these should
normally not be changed.

=================================

=================================
B) Board Model Number (unknown)
R) Board Revision (unknown)
S) Serial Number (unknown)
M) Base MAC Address (0x20fb7000000)
N) Number of MAC Addresses (0)
W) Save Board Manufacturing Data to Flash
Q) Return to main menu

Choice:
----

At this point the manufacturing user must enter the associated information
and choose *"W) Save Board Manufacturing Data to Flash"*.  This
records the manufacturing data at a fixed location in flash (0xff0000).
Once entered, the manufacturing data will not be updated again.

=== Format of the Manufacturing Information

In normal usage, the exact encoding of the manufacturing information is
hidden.  If a board manufacturer wishes to customize their flow, the
manufacturing information device tree can be directly written to flash.
The source of the device tree needs to be compiled with *dtc* and the
binary tree written to flash at offset *0xff0000*.  Below is a
template for the device tree source.

== [[dts-init]]Common Board Initialization and Configuration

Each board requires several configuration items to ensure it works
correctly with system software.  Some significant configuration items are:

* DRAM configuration
* QLM mode and frequency
* QLM clocking
* QLM tuning
* BGX enable and disables
* BMC TWSI interface
* CCPI and multi-node settings
* GPIO configuration
* USB power settings
* Boot watchdog support
* Diagnostics parameters (EYE diagram, etc)
* MDIO/TWSI connections for PHYs
* MDIO/TWSI custom writes for the board

Since there are a large number parameters here, Cavium supplies a
number of example configurations.  Each example corresponds to a board
Cavium ships.  These examples can be used as a basis for customer boards
by copying one of the *BOARD.dts* files and using it as a base.  Once the
DTS file is ready, it is run through the device tree compiler and
loaded onto the board.

Inside the sample configuration files, you will find a list of options with comments
describing them. Following is a typical example of a configuration item:

----
    /* Determine how multi-node is supported for this system:
        0 = Multi-node is not supported
        1 = Multi-node is supported and booting requires two nodes
        2 = Multi-node is auto detected. Two nodes are used if
            if available, otherwise fall back to single node. */
    //MULTI-NODE = "2";
----

The MULTI-NODE configuration item can take the values 0, 1, and 2. Although the
default value generally allows booting, it must be set correctly for the board. For
multiboot, the default value is 2, corresponding to auto detection. In the
configuration files, the default value of a parameter appear as a // comment.

When changing the parameter, Cavium recommends doing the following:

. Copy the // line.
. Remove the //.
. Set the parameter.

Below is the recommended edit to make the board single node only.

----
    /* Determine how multi-node is supported for this system:
        0 = Multi-node is not supported
        1 = Multi-node is supported and booting requires two nodes
        2 = Multi-node is auto detected. Two nodes are used if
            if available, otherwise fall back to single node. */
    //MULTI-NODE = "2";
    MULTI-NODE = "0";
----

Some configuration items can be specified with parameters to represent
node, lane, etc.  For example, the following configuration item
specifies DRAM speed.

----
    /* Speed grade to use for DRAM in MT/s. Hardware may adjust this value
    slightly to improve DRAM stability, so scope measurements may not
    exactly match the frequency with MT/s. The Cavium supported speed
    grades are:
        666 MT/s
        800 MT/s
        1066 MT/s
        1333 MT/s
        1600 MT/s
        1866 MT/s
        2133 MT/s (DDR4 only)
    Parameters:
        N#: Parameter can be different for each node. This specifies
            which node the value is for. Node must be 0-3. Optional. */
    //DDR-SPEED.N%d = "0";
----

Note the .N%d in the configuration item name.  This represents the node
number that applies to this DRAM configuration.  If all nodes are
identical, the node parameter can be omitted.  When searching for
configuration settings, the firmware starts with the most specific
setting (most dot parameters), and progresses to the least specific
setting (no dot parameters).  The first match that is found is used.
This allows for common settings at a global level with more specific
overrides later.  The following lines are all valid DDR-SPEED settings.

----
    DDR-SPEED.N0 = "2133"; // Only applies to Node 0
    DDR-SPEED.N1 = "1866"; // Only applies to Node 1
    DDR-SPEED = "2133"; // Applies to all nodes.
----

All configuration items are listed in the
*${BDK_ROOT}/boards/generic.dts* file.  Generally it is best to start
with the Cavium board configuration file that most closely matches your
board.  Individual board files may not have all configuration items, so
referring to generic.dts can be helpful.

=== DRAM Without SPDs

Some embedded designs mount DRAM directly to the board instead of using
standard DIMMs.  In these boards the *DDR-CONFIG-SPD-ADDR* fields must
be left as zero.  The DRAM configuration must be stored in
*DDR-CONFIG-SPD-DATA.DIMM%d.LMC%d.N%d* in the same binary format used in
DIMMs.  Below is an example captured from a CRB-2S with DDR4.

=== Device Tree important nodes

The above example device tree can be used as a basis for cn81xx based
customer boards.  dts file is built by the device tree compiler and
loaded to board.  some of the nodes & properties are fixed for cn81xx
silicon and some varies based on the boards.

In the example device tree file, initial fields contain the silicon
model and the interrupt controller used.  cpus contain the core info.

SoC::

soc@0 refers to the system on chip properties.  All other cn81xx
parameters are stored within this node.

PCI::

ecam0 refers to the PCI Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism which
helps PCI driver to discover PCI devices.  For more details,refer to
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/host-generic-pci.txt

PHY configuration::

PHYs are added under MDIO node(SMI/MDIO interface is used to communicate
with PHY devices.  Below are the device tree properties for PHY

=== Fixups Performed During Boot

To simplify maintenance of operating system device trees, the firmware
will perform the following transforms on the device tree.  This allows
the device tree to contain configuration for many setups / boards, and
to be dynamically pruned based on the current system.

1) Remove CPU clusters and L2 caches for nodes not in the system.
----
        /cpus/cpu-map/cluster#
        /cpus/l2-cache#
        /cpus/cpu-map/cluster#/core#
        /cpus/cpu@#
----
2) Remove unused SOCs for multi-node systems.
----
        /interrupt-controller@801000000000/gic-its@#
        /soc@#
        /memory@#
----
3) Remove unused PCIe interfaces (PEMs).
----
        /soc@#/pci@#
----
4) Update SMMU mmu-masters for removed PCIe.

5) Remove node entries marked with unused qlm-mode entries.

6) Update local-mac-address properties for manufacturing data.

7) Update the uart reference clocks
----
        /soc@#/refclkuaa
                clock-frequency
----
8) Update the SCLK reference clocks.
----
        /soc@#/sclk
                clock-frequency
----
9) Rename cavium,pci-host-thunder-pem to pci-host-thunder-pem for chips that do not require Cavium ECAM errata workarounds.

10) Patch memory size for installed memory.

11) Remove /distance-map if the the system is single node.

== [[dts-board]]Per Board Changeable Configuration

Some parameters from <<dts-init,Common Board Initialization and Configuration>> are
changeable on a running system.  This supports minor tweaks to the
configuration based on the current system usage.  These parameters
are tweaked through the setup menu, available in the *Boot Options*
menu.  Settings changed through this path create a device tree
*default.dtb* stored in the flash FAT file system.  These settings are
considered temporary overrides, lost either during firmware update or
through a factory reset.

== Firmware Update

Firmware updates in the field cause the following changes in the four
device tree configuration files.

* <<dts-manuf,Per Board Manufacturing Information>> is preserved. No changes are made.
* <<dts-init,Common Board Initialization and Configuration>> is replaced with the new data in the firmware update.
* <<dts-os,Operating System Configuration>> is replaced with the new data in the firmware update.
* <<dts-board,Per Board Changeable Configuration>> is deleted, losing any customization.

=== Misconfigured warning messages

==== Missing Device Tree

  ********************************************************
  * Board manufacturing information not found.  Program
  * the board manufacturing information in the Setup menu.
  ********************************************************

The device tree describing the board manufacturing data was missing.  It
is suppose to be at 0xff0000 in flash.  The user must enter the
manufacturing data again in the setup menu. See <<dts-manuf,Per Board Manufacturing Information>>.

==== Mismatched Board Name

  ********************************************************
  * Board configuration file not found. Either the board
  * model is incorrect, or factory settings are not
  * available. DTB file not found for board "XXX".
  ********************************************************

The board name specified in the manufacturing information did not match a
device tree file name.  This means the board manufacturing data was
entered wrong, or a device tree for this board was not included in the
flash image.  Either fix the board name, or add the correct device tree to
flash. See <<dts-init,Common Board Initialization and Configuration>>.

==== Operating System Configuration Not Found

 ********************************************************
 * Operating system device tree not found. Operating
 * system may not boot properly. DTB file not found for
 * board "EBB8800".
 ********************************************************

The <<dts-os,Operating System Configuration>> was not found.  The files
BOARD-REV-linux.dtb, BOARD-linux.dtb, and generic-linux.dtb do not exist
or are corrupt.

=== Combining of the Four Device Trees

During boot, the four different device tree files are combined into one
unified view.  The following step are performed.

. <<dts-manuf,Per Board Manufacturing Information>> is loaded from offset 0xff0000 in flash.
. Either BOARD-REVISION.dtb or BOARD.dtb is loaded. This contains <<dts-init,Common Board Initialization and Configuration>>.
. The <<dts-manuf,Per Board Manufacturing Information>> is merged into the dtb file loaded above. This creates the BDK device tree.
. Either BOARD-REVISION-linux.dtb, BOARD-linux.dtb, or generic-linux.dtb is loaded. This contains <<dts-os,Operating System Configuration>>.
. The BDK device tree is merged into the linux dtb file loaded above.
. The device tree fixups detailed in [[#Fixups Performed During Boot]] are applied to the dtb.
. The final dtb is passed to the system software.

== Cavium Board Names

Details for Cavium boards:

* "EBB8800": Revision "G-01", as silkscreened on the board.
* "EBB8804": Revision "G-01", as silkscreened on the board.
* "EBB8604": Revision "G-01", as silkscreened on the board.
* "CRB-1s" : Revisions "0.1", "0.2", "0.3" as silkscreened on the board.
* "CRB-2s" : Revisions "EVT2", "EVT3", "EVT4".  Not marked on boards.

Note that board revision is especially important for the CRB-2S, as the
DDR4 reference clock changed in the EVT4 revision.
