[[PCIE]]
= PCI Express (PCIe)

The BDK supports testing PCIe ports in root complex mode.  Basic bus
initialization and enumeration can be performed even before DDR3 is
working.  The sequence is simply to perform the items in the PCIe menu it
order.

----

== PCIe#: Initialize

Bringup PCIe link "#" and report the number of lanes and speed of the interface.

== PCIe#: Scan for devices

Use PCIe config cycles to scan bus "#" for devices.  The devices found
can be displayed in a following menu option.  Note that this option
only finds devices and does not assign resources.  This makes it easier
to see device discovery when a PCIe analyzer is connected.

== PCIe#: Enumerate devices

Iterate through the devices found in the scan an assign resources to
them.  After this step is complete, devices will have valid BAR setups
and respond to memory transactions.

== PCIe#: Display devices

Display the devices found on the bus and show details about each BAR
register.

== PCIe#: Perform a memory read

Issue a PCIe memory read transaction on the bus.  Prompts will be
issued for the PCIe address to read from and the number of bytes to
read.

== PCIe#: Perform a memory write

Issue a PCIe memory write transaction on the bus.  Prompts will be
issued for the PCIe address to write and the data.  The data should be
input as a series of hex digits, two per byte.

== PCIe#: Shutdown

Shutdown the PCIe link.  This might be useful if you want to test link
robustness by performing a series of initialization and shutdown
sequences.
