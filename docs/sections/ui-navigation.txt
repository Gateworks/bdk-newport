[[NAVIGATION]]
= Navigating Menus and Answering Prompts

All menus in the BDK start with a banner followed by a list of
numbered options.  Options are chosen by typing the associated number
into the "Menu Choice:" prompt and pressing ENTER.  Leaving a prompt
blank signals that input should be aborted, passing control passes
back to the menu.  All menus have the last option as an exit of the
menu and return to the previous menu.

Some menu options require extra input from the user.  These accept
keyboard input followed by the ENTER key.  Leaving a field blank, or
hitting Control-C abort input.  Control goes back to the menu.
Numeric input can be in decimal (default) or hexadecimal by beginning
the number with "0x" (zero followed by "x", similar to the C
programming language).

= Line Editing

Any prompt ending with ">" supports full line editing and history. Generally
speaking, arrow keys, home, end, insert, and delete work as expected.

* Use 'ARROW KEYS', 'HOME', 'END' or *vi* style commands 'ESC-h', 'ESC-j', 'ESC-k', 'ESC-l', 'ESC-0', 'ESC-$', 'ESC-w', or 'ESC-b' for navigation.
* Scroll through previous commands using the 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys.
* Use 'INSERT' to toggle insert/overwrite mode, 'DELETE' to delete, 'F1' for help.
* Many *vi* style modes are available for command and history navigation.
* Use 'TAB' for command completion, multiple to cycle, or 'CTRL-D' for a list of possible commands.
* Use 'ESC-i', 'ESC-A' ,'ESC-a', 'ESC-c' for insert mode, 'ESC-R', 'ESC-r' for overwrite mode (behavior like *vi*).
* Use '!!', '!<num>' or '!<string>' to repeat previous commands in the history.
* Use '::', ':<num>' or ':<string>' to recall previous commands in the history to current.
* Use '?<string>', '/<string>', 'ESC-?<string>', 'ESC-/<string>', 'ESC-n', 'ESC-N' to also recall to current.
* Use 'CTRL-l' erase the screen, 'ESC-D' to clear the rest of the current line.
* Use 'ESC-d<movement>' to delete, 'ESC-~' to change case, 'ESC-u' to undo (one level).
* See the *vi* man page for more info on the operation of various commands.
