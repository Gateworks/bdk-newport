= Using the BDK host Scripts to Control the Target

Lua scripts run on the host PC can remotely control the target through
a serial connection. The serial connection can be either through the
host's serial port (example /dev/ttyUSB0) or using a TCP/IP socket
connection to a terminal server. The connection is controlled by a
environment variable on the host, *CAVIUM_REMOTE_CONSOLE*.
