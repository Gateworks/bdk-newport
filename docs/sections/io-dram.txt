[[DRAM]]
= Configure and Test DDR

Configuring DDR for a board can be quite involved, so it is best to
start with a working configuration and customize it.  The recommended
procedure is to copy an existing DDR configuration for one of Cavium's
evaluation boards and then perform the minimal changes needed for the
new board.  Starting in the DDR menu, follow these steps.

.Sample DDR Menu

== Copy an Existing Configuration

Choose one of the menu options which most closely matches the board.
Make sure to pick a board configuration that has the same Cavium chip.

== Set the DDR Clock Frequency

Choose the DDR frequency which memory will be clocked at.  The
frequency specified here is the base frequency of the clock.  DDR
DIMMs are generally labeled by data rate instead of clock rate.  Since
data is transferred on every clock edge, the clock rate is always half
the data rate.  For example, a DIMM labeled "DDR3 - 1333" has a
maximum data rate of 1333 64bit words per second, corresponding to a
clock rate of 666.5 Mhz.  This clock rate would be entered as
'666500000'.  During initial configuration, start with a low clock
rate and raise it later after DRAM is tested.  A good starting clock
rate is 500Mhz, so enter '500000000'.

== Enter DIMM SPD Addresses

When designing the board, the DIMM slots must be connected to one of
THUNDERX's TWSI buses to allow for access to the DIMM SPD.  DDR
configuration must include the TWSI bus and address used for the
board.  Choose the menu option 'Set SPD TWSI addresses'.

.Sample SPD Entry
----
DDR interface (0 - 3): (14INS)> 0
TWSI interface number  (0-4): (15INS)> 0
Enter SPD address of 0 to end input.

SPD address for dimm 0: (16INS)> 0x50
SPD address for dimm 1: (17INS)> 0x51
SPD address for dimm 2: (18INS)> 0
----

== Apply the new Configuration

Now that your DDR configuration has been customized for the board.
Apply the configuration using the menu option.  Choose 'Initialize DDR
controller using current config'.

== Test DDR

Once DRAM is configured, test to make sure memory is working.  Testing is
contained in a submenu for the DRAM menu.

.Bringup Cores for multi-core testing

A single CPU core is limited in the amount of DRAM load it can produce.
It is recommended that you select this option to make sure all CPU cores
are active and available for testing.

.Number of time to repeat the test (1)

Once initial tests pass, this option can be used run tests over long time
periods.  Stable memory is required for Uboot and the SDK to work
properly.  Note that if you have a specific DRAM test that is failing,
this option can repeat the test to help in connecting scopes to the board.

.Starting address (0x0) and Length of the range to check (All)

Choose the memory range to test.  The default will check all of memory,
except for a small segment containing the BDK.  The BDK is loaded as
address zero and takes up a linear range.  The starting address will
automatically be adjusted to be above the BDK.  This normally causes the
lower couple of megabytes to not be tested.  Lengths that extend passed
the end of configured memory are automatically truncated.

.Set test range from 64MB to 128MB

It is recommended you start testing with a small memory range as a sanity
test before covering all of memory.  This options creates an easy default
range.

.Run all DRAM tests

This option runs all the other DRAM tests over the supplied range.  Each
test is run sequentially, one after the other.  Any DRAM error will stop
testing and return to the menu.

== Dealing with Complex DDR Customization

The menu interface presents option to configure DDR on the most common
board configurations.  In the event that the board needs further
customization.  DDR configurations can be saved and restored from
files.  All DDR options may be customized by first saving a
configuration to a file.  Use either XMODEM or the builtin TFTP server
to transfer the file off of THUNDERX.  After editing the configuration
file, transfer it back to THUNDERX.

CAUTION: The DDR configuration file format may change in future BDKs.
Be sure to track your specific changes such that they can be applied
to a new configuration exported from a future BDK.

== DDR Customization with Fixed SPDs

DDR Configurations requiring fixed SPD data not read from a DDR DIMM
requires the use of the save/modify/load update procedure.

. Use "Load current DDR config using XXX" to load a sample DDR configuration.
. Save the sample configuration using "Save current DDR config to a file".
. Open the DDR config in a text editor.
. Change the SPD addresses to zero for configurations that need it.

== Asking for Help with DRAM

When contacting Cavium's customer support, the following information
will be needed.  Detailed logs are _very_ important for diagnosing
DDR problems, so be sure to capture all output given.

. Give details about the board's configuration
. Enable Verbose Output
. Display the current DDR config
. Initialize DDR controller using current config
