[[TWSI]]
= TWSI (I2C)

The BDK support probing TWSI (I2C) using basic operations.  Testing
general connectivity is done using an automated device address scan.
Further details about individual TWSI devices can be probed using
manual reads and writes.  The first step is to choose a TWSI
bus for testing.  This is done in the main TWSI menu.

.Sample TWSI Main Menu
----
include::../captures/twsi_main_menu.capture[]
----

Once a bus is selected, the TWSI sub menu allows operations on the bus.

== Initialize TWSI

Perform one time bus initialization of the TWSI controller.
This needs to be done once before any other transactions are issued.


== Scan TWSI

Scan all valid TWSI addresses looking for devices.  Each device that
responds is displayed in a list.  This can be useful way of
determining what devices are available on a board.  Below is sample
scan from a EBB6800 board.

TIP: Be sure to note the address and bus of any DIMMs.  Later when
DDR3 is tested, SPD data will need to be read from TWSI using these
addresses.

== Read

Perform a TWSI read.  Prompts will ask for the device address,
internal address width, internal address, and number of bytes to read
(1,2,4).

.Sample TWSI read
----
Device address(13INS)> 1
Internal address width (0, 1, or 2)(14INS)> 0
Number of bytes to read(15INS)> 1
Result: 246 (0xf6)
----

== Write

Perform a TWSI write.  Prompts will ask for the device address,
internal address width, internal address, number of bytes to write
(1,2,4), and the data to write.

.Sample TWSI write
----
Device address(10INS)> 11
Internal address width (0, 1, or 2)(11INS)> 1
Internal address(12INS)> 0
Number of bytes to write(13INS)> 4
Data to write(14INS)> 0x11223344
