[[CONFIGURE]]
= Configure the BDK

Before detailed testing begins, some parameters need to be set in order
to customize the BDK for the board.  For ethernet tests, covered
later, the PHY addresses and MAC address needs to be set.

CAUTION: Configuration options are *not saved* and will be lost on
reset.  Configuration needs to be redone after every boot.

== Configure the MAC Address

The BDK creates a semi random MAC address based on internal chip
parameters.  This default is normally good enough for lab testing, but
it should be replaced before the board is used on a large LAN.  The
BDK default starts with Cavium's OUI with the locally administered bit
set, '02:0f:b7'.  The next three bytes are derived based on internal
chip data.

== Configure PHY Addresses

RGMII, MII, and SGMII ports on the board should have ethernet PHYs
connected using SMI/MDIO.  Before these ports can be used,
the SMI/MDIO address for each PHY needs to be programmed.  Choose the menu option
for each RGMII, MII, and SGMII port. When prompted, enter the PHY address encoded as follows:

----
Address = <SMI/MDIO address> + 256 * <SMI/MDIO bus>
----

SMI/MDIO address::

This is the address of the PHY as configured by strapping on the board.

SMI/MDIO bus::

This is the number of the SMI/MDIO bus used.

TIP: If the PHY addresses are unknown, the scan utility in the
SMI/MDIO menu can be useful.  It will display all the devices THUNDERX
can automatically find.


Interlaken port X lanes::

The number of QLM lanes to use for Interlaken port X.  Must be 0-8.

Interlaken port X channels::

The number of virtual channels to configure for Interlaken port X.
Must be 0-16.
